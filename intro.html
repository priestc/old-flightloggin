			<h2>What is this, and why is it here?</h2>
	
			Its a logbook web application. It's here to assist pilots in keeping track of their flight time. Paper logbooks are prone to getting lost or destroyed,
			and are a pain to create calculations and summaries. With this site, you never have to worry about leaving your logbook at home, or at the airport,
			because it's always accessible from a internet ready computer, which are very easy to come by these days.

			<h2>OK great! I'm convinced, I'll sign up! How much does it cost for a years membership?</h2>
			
			Zero dollars. I don't believe in charging for things just because you can. Now-a-days webhosting is dirt cheap. There are plenty of site out there
			that have a ton of traffic and get by without resorting to littering the site with ads, or charging a membership fee. Currently I pay 8 dollars a 
			month to run the webserver this site runs on. I'm not a rich person by any means, but $8 a month is nothing. Furthermore, it probably won't be until
			at least a few years from now before the sites outgrows it current hosting and will need to relocate to more expensive hosting.<br /><br />
			
			In summary, the site doesn't need to charge for membership, therefore the site will not charge for membership.
			
			<h2>I've come to learn that you usually get what you pay for. Since this site is free, it probably isn't any good, I'll rather pay $90 a year on this other site.</h2>
			
			Good for you! Just remember, some of the best sites on the internet are free: Facebook, Google, Yahoo, YouTube, <a href="http://runwayfinder.com">RunwayFinder</a>,
			<a href="http://airnav.com">AirNav</a>, etc.
			
			<h2>Ah, I see. I changed my mind, I think I'll sign up! Only one problem, though. I already have my logbook digitalized in another format. Will I have to start all
			over again from scratch?</h2>
			
			No you will not have to start over again from scratch! Flightlogg.in' has a feature that allows you to import flights from another format, such as LogShare backup files,
			and spreadsheet files. If your logbook is in any other format thats not already supported, fell free to send in the file, and we'll figure out a way to get it to work.
			
			<h2>Whats the history behind FlightLogg.in'?</h2>
			
			I started using a certain other electronic logbook website around early 2004. I thought it was a brilliant idea being able to access your logbook from anywhere, as
			well as never having to worry about losing your logbook in a fire, or losing all your logbook data in a computer crash. The only problem was the site was very lacking
			in features, and I knew I could do better. In October 2007, I began working on FlightLogg.in' and eventually launched the site in early May, 2008.
